    conversations(id)   +   conversations_participants(conversationId, userId)

Groups:
    groups(id, name, founderId) -> groups(id, name, founderId, CONVERSATIONID, PRIVATE)
    members_of_groups(memberId, groupId) -> members_of_groups(memberId, GROUPID, STATUS)

    Now has a chat box, only members of the group can chat.
    Can be public or private.
    Public groups:
        Anyone can look at the page
        Anyone who joins will be accepted
    Private groups:
        Only members can look at the page
        Anyone who joins has to be accepted by the founder
        A notification will be sent to the founder when a user wants to join their group
