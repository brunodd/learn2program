In this section you find all the sql queries that are used throughout the project.
If the query is used as part of a function, only the sql query is shown. This is done as not to
clutter the appendix, since php code is not relevant for this section. 

\subsection{Tables}
Below is a listing of all queries that were used to create the database. It lists
the tables of the database and the specifications of each column.
\input{raport_files/appendix/table.tex}

\subsection{Triggers}
Below is a list of all the triggers used to guarantee proper use of the database.
Most triggers are strictly speaking not necessary as they were also implemented in the
application itself. The triggers were added nonetheless since they are part of the database
design and add an extra level of protection.

\subsection{Helpers}
This section lists all queries that were used throughout the program. It contains queries such
as 'inserts', 'updates', 'selects', etc. Above each query is the function name in which it was
used. Obviously some functions also contain php code, but this was omitted as stated at the top of
this page.
